# Grod design document

Grod is a memory database that stores data in string key-value pairs. It is designed to be fast and efficient, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

Grod stands for Game Resource Overlay Database, and it is intended to be used in game development for storing string game resources such as text, filenames, and other game-related data.

Grod uses a parent-child relationships to hold data. Each key in a parent level can be overridden by a child level. The purpose is to track all changes made to the data, allowing for easy saving and loading of game states. Reading data can be done either on the current level or by searching through all levels until a match is found.

Keys are not case-sensitive. They cannot be null or empty or only whitespace. They also cannot start or end with whitespace. Values cannot be null but can be empty or only whitespace. If a null value is provided, the item will be removed from the database.

## Get

The `Get` operation retrieves the value associated with a given key. The `recursive` parameter indicates if parent levels are searched whenever the child level does not contain a key. If the key is not found in any level, null is returned.

## Set

The `Set` operation assigns a value to a given key. If the value is null, the key is removed from the current level. If the key already exists in the current level, its value is updated. If the key does not exist, it is added to the current level.

Values are only set in the current level. Setting a value does not affect parent levels.

## Remove

The `Remove` operation deletes a key-value pair from the current level. If the key does not exist in the current level, no action is taken.

## Clear

The `Clear` operation removes all key-value pairs from the current level. Parent levels are also cleared if the `recursive` parameter is set to true.

## Keys

The `Keys` operation returns a list of all keys in the current level. If the `recursive` parameter is set to true, keys from parent levels are also included.

The `sorted` parameter indicates if the returned keys should be sorted alphabetically ignoring case.

## Items

The `Items` operation returns a list of all key-value pairs in the current level. If the `recursive` parameter is set to true, key-value pairs from parent levels are also included.

The `sorted` parameter indicates if the returned items should be sorted alphabetically by key ignoring case.

## AddItems

The `AddItems` operation adds multiple key-value pairs to the current level. If a key already exists in the current level, its value is updated. If a key does not exist, it is added to the current level.

## Usage

Grod is designed to be used in scenarios where data needs to be stored and retrieved quickly, such as in game development. It can be used to store game resources, player settings, and other game-related data.

The parent level would be filled with default game resources, while child levels would be used to track changes made during gameplay. This allows for easy saving and loading of game states, as well as the ability to revert to default settings if needed.
