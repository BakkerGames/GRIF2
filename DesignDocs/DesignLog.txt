- Created GRIF2 version 2.2025.810
- Created design document for GRIF2.
- Created design document for GROD2.
- Created GROD2 classes Grod2, Item, Data, Level.
- Grod2 contains a list of levels, each with a list of items.
- Levels can have a parent.
- If a level has a parent, it inherits items from the parent level unless they are overridden.
- Added methods to add levels, set items, and get items with inheritance.
- Created unit tests for Grod2.

- Simplified Grod to be a smaller class with the base of a Dictionary.
- Added methods to set values by key.
- Added methods to get values by key, optionally recursively.
- Added methods to remove items by key, optionally recursively.
- Added methods to clear all items.
- Added methods to get a list of all keys, sorted and/or recursively.
- Added methods to get a list of all GrodItems, sorted and/or recursively.
- Changed to return null if a key is not found instead of throwing an exception.
- Added unit tests for GrodItem and Grod.
- Removed GRIF2 project and changed to just Grif.
