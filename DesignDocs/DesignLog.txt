- Created GRIF2 version 2.2025.810
- Created design document for GRIF2.
- Created design document for GROD2.
- Created GROD2 classes Grod2, Item, Data, Level.
- Grod2 contains a list of levels, each with a list of items.
- Levels can have a parent.
- If a level has a parent, it inherits items from the parent level unless they are overridden.
- Added methods to add levels, set items, and get items with inheritance.
- Created unit tests for Grod2.
