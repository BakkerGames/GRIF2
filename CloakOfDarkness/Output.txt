Cloak of Darkness

A basic IF demonstration.

Hurrying through the rainswept November night, you're glad to see the bright
lights of the Opera House. It's surprising that there aren't more people about
but, hey, what do you expect in a cheap demo game...?

Foyer of the Opera House

You are standing in a spacious hall, splendidly decorated in red and gold, with
glittering chandeliers overhead. The entrance from the street is to the north,
and there are doorways south and west.

A velvet cloak

A handsome cloak, of velvet trimmed with satin, and slightly spattered with

room.

This isn't the best place to leave a smart cloak lying around.

You aren't carrying anything.

Foyer bar

The bar, much rougher than you'd have guessed after the opulence of the foyer to
the north, is completely empty. There seems to be some sort of message scrawled
in the sawdust on the floor.

>e

You can't go that direction.
