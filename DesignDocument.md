# GRIF2 Design Document

## Overview

Create a predesessor to the original GRIF engine that expands the capabilities of the original engine. The new engine should be able to handle more complex interactive fiction games, support additional features, and provide a better user experience.

The new engine should be designed to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements and modifications without breaking existing functionality.

## Goals

- Create a more robust and flexible engine that can handle a wider range of interactive fiction games.
- Improve the user interface and user experience for both players and game developers.
- Support additional features such as save/load functionality, custom commands, and more complex game mechanics.
- Ensure compatibility with existing GRIF games while providing a path for future game development.
- Provide a clear and comprehensive documentation for both users and developers.
- Implement a modular architecture that allows for easy addition of new features and game types.
- Support multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Ensure the engine is lightweight and efficient, minimizing resource usage while maximizing performance.
- Implement a testing framework to ensure the reliability and stability of the engine.

## Projects

- **GRIF2 Engine**: The core engine that runs interactive fiction games, providing the necessary functionality to interpret and execute game scripts.
- **GRIF2 Game Format**: A new game format that extends the capabilities of the original GRIF format, allowing for more complex game mechanics and features.
- **GRIF2 Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for both users and developers, including tutorials, API references, and design guidelines.
- **GRIF2 Examples**: A collection of example games that demonstrate the capabilities of the GRIF2 engine and serve as a reference for game developers.
- **GRIF2 Tools**: A set of tools for game developers to create, test, and debug their games, including a game editor, script debugger, and testing framework.
- **DAGS2 Scripting Language**: A new scripting language designed for writing interactive fiction games, providing a more powerful and flexible way to create game logic and mechanics.
- **GROD2 Data Structure**: A new data structure for managing game state, allowing for more complex interactions and game mechanics.


## Design Principles

- **Simplicity**: The engine should be easy to use and understand, both for players and developers. The design should prioritize clarity and ease of use over complexity.
- **Extensibility**: The architecture should allow for easy addition of new features and game types without breaking existing functionality. This includes a modular design that separates core functionality from game-specific logic.
- **Performance**: The engine should be lightweight and efficient, minimizing resource usage while maximizing performance. This includes optimizing the game loop, memory management, and input/output operations.
- **Compatibility**: The engine should be compatible with existing GRIF games, allowing players to continue enjoying their favorite games while providing a path for future game development.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation should be provided for both users and developers, including tutorials, API references, and design guidelines. This will help ensure that the engine is accessible to a wide audience and can be easily adopted by game developers.
- **Testing**: A robust testing framework should be implemented to ensure the reliability and stability of the engine. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to cover all aspects of the engine's functionality.


## Implementation Plan

1. **Core Engine Development**: Implement the core engine functionality, including the game loop, input handling, and output rendering. This will form the foundation of the GRIF2 engine.
1. **Game Format Design**: Design the new GRIF2 game format, including the syntax and semantics for game scripts, data structures, and game state management.
1. **Scripting Language Development**: Develop the DAGS2 scripting language, including the parser, interpreter, and runtime environment. This will provide a powerful and flexible way to create game logic and mechanics.
1. **Documentation Creation**: Write comprehensive documentation for both users and developers, including tutorials, API references, and design guidelines. This will help ensure that the engine is accessible and easy to use.
1. **Example Games Development**: Create a collection of example games that demonstrate the capabilities of the GRIF2 engine and serve as a reference for game developers. This will help showcase the engine's features and provide inspiration for new games.
1. **Tools Development**: Develop a set of tools for game developers, including a game editor, script debugger, and testing framework. These tools will help streamline the game development process and improve productivity.
1. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Implement a robust testing framework to ensure the reliability and stability of the engine. This will include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to cover all aspects of the engine's functionality.
1. **Release and Community Engagement**: Release the GRIF2 engine and engage with the community to gather feedback, address issues, and encourage contributions. This will help build a vibrant community around the engine and ensure its continued development and improvement.
1. **Ongoing Maintenance and Enhancement**: Continuously maintain and enhance the engine based on user feedback and evolving needs. This will include fixing bugs, adding new features, and improving performance as necessary.
